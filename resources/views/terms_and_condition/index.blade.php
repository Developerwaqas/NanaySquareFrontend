                                and maintain quality care. The Services we offer include, among others: We provide a
                                platform for individuals seeking care services and others willing to provide such
                                services. Our platform allows care providers to create profiles and indicate services
                                they are willing to offer, their desired rates / pay and availability. Care recipients
                                can use our platform to create their profiles and search for care providers that meet
                                their criteria. Recipients and providers agree between themselves (with no intervention
                                or communication with Nanny Square) on the rates, service provided, service location,
                                service dates, service duration, start and end times, terms of care provided e.g.,
                                number of children, special needs, dietary restrictions, meal prep, etc.) and living
                                arrangements for providers if they intend to live with the family receiving care. To the
                                fullest extent permitted by applicable law Nanny Square shall not be liable for any
                                direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but
                                not limited to damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible
                                losses, resulting from any misunderstanding, misrepresentation or dissatisfaction with
                                any of the negotiated terms between provider and recipient. The care arrangement is at
                                will and can be terminated at any time by any party subject to any previously agreed
                                terms between parties such as notice or severance.

                                through PayPal login. These payment processing services are provided by Stripe and
