                                At NannySquare.com, we care – about you, your safety, your security, and your
                                experience. We provide tips and tools to help you have safe experiences and stand ready
                                to support you if you need it

                                We put together these guidelines to foster a safe community. We believe that our
                                community should be driven by a set of values and conduct. Any member may be temporarily
                                or permanently removed for violating these guidelines.

                                <li>We do not perform background checks or screen new members because we are not a job
                                    or babysitting agency. Rather, think of Nanny Square as a platform where parents and
                                    independent childcare providers – including babysitters and nannies – can find and
                                    connect with each other. That means screening is in the hands of our members.
                                    Parents, nannies, and babysitters can vet each other based on their own priorities
                                    and preferences. Beyond exercising common sense when it comes to sharing personal
                                    details, we suggest you carefully review provided references and plan an official
                                    interview before making any final decisions. When you’ve found the perfect match,
                                    you’ll be glad you took the time to make sure everything was on the up and up.

                                <li>All NannySquare.com members are expected to be respectful in every interaction,
                                    whether online or in person. Communication or conduct that expresses hate, bullying,
                                    harassment, or discrimination is not allowed.
                                </li>
                                <li>Privacy is important. Do not share photos of children without the legal guardian’s
                                    consent. Do not place “nanny cams” in bathrooms that a caregiver might use. Refrain
                                    from asking personal questions that have no bearing on the job without explicit
                                    invitation, and never include personal identifying information in your care
                                    requests, applications, profiles or reviews.

                                <li>We do not tolerate any threatened, actual or attempted acts of physical assault,
                                    child abuse, or other violent acts. This includes corporal punishment.

                                <li>Sexual misconduct, harassment, abuse, exploitation, or assault is grounds for
                                    removal from the platform. And sexual activity between caregivers and adult family
                                    accountholders is always prohibited — even if consensual.</li>

                                <li>Upon ending a caregiving relationship, you must return house keys, car seats,
                                    leashes, and other items provided by the family or caregiver that do not belong to
                                    you.

                                    Provide accurate personal information to NannySquare.com and the members you connect
                                    with on the platform. Don’t send someone else to do work that you were hired to do.
                                    Misrepresenting your identity and/or signing up to facilitate someone else to use
                                    the platform is grounds for removal from the platform.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Families rely on caregivers’ experience when making hiring decisions. Similarly,
                                    caregivers rely on families’ descriptions of their needs to ensure they can commit
                                    to providing the necessary care. Don’t lie about your qualifications or care needs.

                                </li>
                                <li>Identity theft, scams, and all other forms of fraud are not tolerated in this
                                    community.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Care should be delivered in a clean and safe environment. Whether care takes place
                                    in the families’ home, the provider’s home, or someplace else, ensure there are no:
                                    unsecured firearms, hazards, excessively unsanitary conditions, dangerous or
                                    uninhabitable care conditions, or illegal drugs.

                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Caregiving is serious business. Caregivers should not be under the influence of
                                    marijuana, alcohol, illegal drugs, or any other substance that impacts or impairs
                                    judgment while providing care. Both families and caregivers should stay accessible
                                    and reachable throughout caregiving engagements.

                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Be an accountable member of our community and report any safety concerns using the
                                    Report tool on the site.

                                    Laws were made for a reason. We have zero tolerance for individuals engaging in
                                    illegal criminal activity. This includes, but is not limited to, fraud, theft,
                                    kidnapping, human trafficking, extortion, assault, sexual assault, and child sexual
                                    exploitation. And families should be mindful of laws applicable to domestic
                                    employment.
